Try putting and getting multiple entries (let's say 5-7 operations) into a map. You will likely get annoyed by having to type the map's name every time.

We're proposing 3 solutions to that problem. There are 3 commands with those proposals available under `hzc1`, `hzc2` and `hzc3` command. Please, give it a try with each of them and let us know which suits you the best.

In other words:
* Type `hzc1` and hit Enter - you'll enter the interactive mode
* Try putting/getting (`map put` and `map get`) 7 entries without having to type map's name each time
* Repeat the above for `hzc2` and `hzc3`
* Provide feedback to Jiri Holusa directly via Slack/email about which one was the most intuitive
